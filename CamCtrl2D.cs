 * Creator:             MoonJumpMania
 * Use:                 Moves the camera in chosen direction in correspondace to the player
 * Application:         Plug this script to camera in the scene
 * Public Variables:    offset variables move the camera away from the player
 *                      booleans able and disable camera translation in specific axis
 *                      bounce changes how smooth or slow the camera feels
